There are two ways:

1. Replace the existing soundtrack: by placing the music folder in the mount&blade directory, and click yes to overwriting.
   IMPORTANT: Make a backup of the original music folder if you wish to keep it.

2. To install the soundtrack in one particular mod, then do as follows:

- open the 'module.ini' file in the mod you wish to install Ambient Soundtrack into.
- find the line that says:  


               scan_module_sounds = 0


Replace the 0 with a 1 - like so:


               scan_module_sounds = 1


Remember to save.

- Place the music.txt in the mod and say yes to overwriting.

- Finally place the music files in the 'music' folder in the mod. Play the mod and listen.


Any questions or feedback, then go to the thread at taleworlds.
