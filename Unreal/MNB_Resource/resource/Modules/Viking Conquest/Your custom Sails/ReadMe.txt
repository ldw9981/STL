Those 2 PSD-files are the templates for players, where they can create
their own custom sail texture. Instructions for this are included in the
PSDs. 

Only the player's fleet will be able to choose this custom sail. This way players can personalise their fleet's
sails.

If the player hasn't changed the texture, it remains as it looked previously - a plain, uncoloured sail.
